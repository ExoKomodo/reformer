Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood
of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing
in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
