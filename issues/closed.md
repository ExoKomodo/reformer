## Setup Nginx

### Branch - [setup-nginx](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/setup-nginx)

### Overview

[`nginx`](https://nginx.org/en/) is a super simple load balancer/web server, which also serves static file serving.

### Instructions

Set up a simple nginx, with a proxy pass from port 80 to 8080

Something like this

```nginx
server {
  listen        80;

  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
  rewrite_log on;

  location / {
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
    proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    proxy_pass         http://0.0.0.0:8080;
  }
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- Have nginx run on port 80
- Have port 80 and 8080 exposing the same thing, but only 80 goes through the LB
- Get Digital Ocean to pass through the LB port

## Setup hosting solution

### Branch (n/a)

### Overview

Since the backend does SSR of the page, we need a hosting solution that will run the code and be routable,
since we won't be generating static webpages.

### Instructions

1. Deploy to a hosting solution (Using Digital Ocean)
1. Have a CD pipeline to automatically update the hosted site (builds a docker container on every push to main)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Automatically updated hosting site
- Automatic SSL updates
- Cheap

## Public Domain

### Branch - [public-domain](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/public-domain)

### Overview

Project should be public domain, ala [`The Dorean Principle`](https://thedoreanprinciple.org) found throughout scripture.

### Instructions

Add a public domain disclaimer to the codebase

### Acceptance Criteria

Do something like SQLite's `LICENSE.md`:

```markdown
The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
a legal notice, here is a blessing:

  *   May you do good and not evil.
  *   May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
  *   May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
```

## Add directory for external docs

### Branch - [external-docs](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/external-docs)

### Overview

Many of the Lisp technologies used have comprehensive HTML manuals. It would be great to have these available for offline.
development.

### Instructions

Where possible, we should store these documents local to this project. We intend to eventually post the docs for
[`Reformer`](https://reformer.fyi) on a website, so put these in a location that would not be included. So do not use the
[`docs/`](../docs) directory, but rather [`external/docs/`](../external/docs).

### Acceptance Criteria

- Create the [`external/docs/`](../external/docs) directory.
- Link to this directory from the main [`README.md`](../README.md).

## Setup ASDF project

### Branch - [setup-asdf](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/setup-asdf)

### Overview

[`ASDF`](https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/) is the ubiquitous build facility/project management tool for Common Lisp.

### Instructions

Set up the base project/system definition required by `ASDF`, and store the docs local to our project.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Add `ASDF` to the `deps` target in the [`Makefile`](../Makefile).
- Add `ASDF` manual to [`external/docs/`](../external/docs).
- Create [`reformer.asd`](../src/reformer.asd).

## Serve static files

### Branch - [static-files](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/static-files)

### Overview

Use [`nginx`](https://nginx.org/en/) to serve static files not generated by the app

### Instructions

1. Define a static file folder for the project
1. Set up a `try_files` directive to serve a static directory
1. Copy static files into [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Serve any static file we want from Nginx
- Update documentation to point out that running nginx is likely always a good idea,
so you can get the static files for the site

## Live reloading

### Branch - [nginx-live-reload](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/nginx-live-reload)

### Overview

Currently, `nginx` is serving a copied directory, so updates need to be manually synced. To avoid this, a symlink should
work, but a `Permission Denied` error happens because of the non-root `nginx` process running on a different user's directory.

### Instructions

1. Symbolically link the static files, instead of `rsync`.
1. Provide a `user` definition in nginx, to allow for overriding the running user.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Be able to run nginx as a desired user and group.
- Container needs to have the static files only ONCE in its tree, with a symlink to that location.

### Bonus

Was able to add volume mounts to the local makefile run, as to allow for live development with the container.

## Load and store data in SQLite

### Branch - [setup-sqlite](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/setup-sqlite)

### Overview

Add a SQLite database to Reformer, for storing persistent data and allowing for us to be stateless.

### Instructions

1. Add a makefile target for installing sqlite
1. Create sqlite db on reformer startup

### Acceptance Criteria

- New developers should be able to run `make setup` and receive `sqlite` properly installed
- Restarting a running app should come back up with prior state.
  - Test this locally for now

## Load and store models in Sqlite

### Branch - [rw-sqlite-models](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/rw-sqlite-models)

### Overview

We need to be able to actually use the database to store our data. Right now there is no translation layer.
Read and write models to and from a Sqlite db.

### Instructions

Add new functions to the existing `<post>` and `<user>` objects.

### Acceptance Criteria

Have info about:

- load models from sqlite
- display posts from actual user data
- use the store functions for filling the test entries for dev

## Allow for adding posts

### Branch - [post-form](https://github.com/exokomodo/reformer/tree/post-form)

### Overview

Be able to create posts in a simple form

### Instructions

- Add a new POST endpoint for post objects
- Submit the form with HTMX

### Acceptance Criteria

User should be able to create a new post, with a user

## Migrate from guile-sqlite to guile-dbi

### Branch - [guile-dbi](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/guile-dbi)

### Overview

Reformer needs to support more than one DB backend. Initially, supporting SQLite and PSQL will be most necessary.

Just create your own

### Instructions

Install [`guile-dbi`](https://github.com/opencog/guile-dbi) to the project. If at all possible, provide the source code
of this library natively in the codebase. If necessary to build the code first in some way, then introduce it as a git
submodule and provide a `make` target for dealing with library compilations.

### Acceptance Criteria

- replace `guile-sqlite` with `guile-dbi`
- if necessary to build `guile-dbi`, add a `make build-libs` target
