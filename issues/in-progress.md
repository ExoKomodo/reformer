# In-Progress Issues

Once completed, move the issue into [closed](./closed.md).

## Create the initial README

### Branch - [initial-readme](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/initial-readme)

### Overview

README is entirely lacking. Provide info about the vision and purpose of the site. Also provide basic development info.
For now, structure is more important than content.

### Instructions

Make a nice README, my guy.

### Acceptance Criteria

Have info about:

- the purpose of the website.
- technologies chosen (and why).
- the development process.

## Public Domain

### Branch - [public-domain](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/public-domain)

### Overview

Project should be public domain, ala [`The Dorean Principle`](https://thedoreanprinciple.org) found throughout scripture.

### Instructions

Add a public domain disclaimer to the codebase

### Acceptance Criteria

Do something like SQLite's `LICENSE.md`:

```markdown
The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
a legal notice, here is a blessing:

  *   May you do good and not evil.
  *   May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
  *   May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
```
