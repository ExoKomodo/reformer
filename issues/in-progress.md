# In-Progress Issues

Once completed, move the issue into [closed](./closed.md).

## Create the initial README

### Branch - [initial-readme](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/initial-readme)

### Overview

README is entirely lacking. Provide info about the vision and purpose of the site. Also provide basic development info.
For now, structure is more important than content.

### Instructions

Make a nice README, my guy.

### Acceptance Criteria

Have info about:

- the purpose of the website.
- technologies chosen (and why).
- the development process.

## Serve static files

### Branch - [static-files](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/static-files)

### Overview

Use [`nginx`](https://nginx.org/en/) to serve static files not generated by the app

### Instructions

1. Define a static file folder for the project
1. Set up a `try_files` directive to serve a static directory
1. Copy static files into [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Serve any static file we want from Nginx
- Update documentation to point out that running nginx is likely always a good idea,
so you can get the static files for the site
