## Setup hosting solution

### Branch (not created) - [setup-hosting](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/setup-hosting)

### Overview

Since the backend does SSR of the page, we need a hosting solution that will run the code and be routable,
since we won't be generating static webpages.

### Instructions

1. Deploy to a hosting solution
1. Have a CD pipeline to automatically update the hosted site

### Acceptance Criteria

- Automatically updated hosting site
- Automatic SSL updates
- Cheap
