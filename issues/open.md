## Serve static files

### Branch - [static-files](https://git.sr.ht/~jamesaorson/reformer/tree/static-files)

### Overview

Use [`nginx`](https://nginx.org/en/) to serve static files not generated by the app

### Instructions

1. Define a static file folder for the project
1. Set up a `try_files` directive to serve a `wwwroot`
1. Copy static files into [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Serve any static file we want from Nginx
- Update documentation to point out that running nginx is likely always a good idea, so you can get the static files for the site
